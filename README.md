## Inspiration
The inspiration for NewsStream came from the growing need for efficient and personalized news consumption in our fast-paced digital world. We recognized that people struggle to keep up with the overwhelming amount of news content available, often lacking the time to read full articles or discern between credible sources. We wanted to create a solution that would aggregate news from reliable sources, provide concise summaries, and offer a personalized experience to help users stay informed without feeling overwhelmed.

## What it does
NewsStream is a cutting-edge news aggregation and summarization platform powered by Redpanda and AI technologies. It:
- Collects news articles from diverse, credible sources in real-time
- Uses Cohere Chat to generate concise, accurate summaries of articles
- Categorizes and tags news content for easy navigation
- Provides personalized news feeds based on user interests and reading history
- Offers a chat interface for users to discuss news topics and ask questions

## How we built it
We built NewsStream using a combination of modern technologies and services:
- Redpanda for high-performance data streaming and real-time news ingestion
